      <div class="col-sm-12"><h3>Abstract</h3></div>
      <div class="col-sm-12 content">Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient deployment of deep networks using a small set of data. Its application to visual autoregressive models (VAR), however, remains relatively unexplored. We identify two key challenges for applying PTQ to VAR: (i) large reconstruction errors in attention–value products, especially at coarse scales where high attention scores occur more frequently; and (ii) a discrepancy between the sampling frequencies of codebook entries and their predicted probabilities due to limited calibration data. To address these challenges, we propose a PTQ framework tailored for VAR. First, we introduce a shift-and-sum quantization method that reduces reconstruction errors by aggregating quantized results from symmetrically shifted duplicates of value tokens. Second, we present a resampling strategy for calibration data that aligns sampling frequencies of codebook entries with their predicted probabilities. Experiments on class-conditional image generation, inpainting, outpainting, and class-conditional editing show consistent improvements across VAR architectures, establishing a new state of the art in PTQ for VAR.</p></div>

      <div class="col-sm-12 caption">Quantitative comparison of quantizing VAR with various methods for the task of conditional image generation on ImageNet.  We denote by W/A the bit-widths of weights (W) and activations (A), respectively. We report IS, FID, and FID2FP16 for VARs of varying depths. Note that we have re-implemented LiteVAR for a fair comparison under consistent evaluation settings.</div>
      <div class="col-sm-12 content">We show in this table a quantitative comparison of our method with prior approaches for the task of class-conditional image generation on ImageNet. We can see that our method consistently outperforms BRECQ across all bit-widths and architectures, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed shift-and-sum quantization and calibration data resampling techniques. In addition, our method achieves quantization performance comparable to LiteVAR, although it retains FC layers after GELU non-linearity in full-precision, which is suboptimal in terms of efficiency. Finally, applying our approach in combination with LiteVAR yields further improvements, suggesting that the two approaches are complementary.</div>
