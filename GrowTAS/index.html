          <strong>Top</strong>: We first train a small subnet and then evaluate 100 larger subnets
          derived from it without further training. To be specific, the large subnets are obtained
          by appending randomly initialized weights to those of the trained one. We can see that
          the large subnets achieve test accuracies comparable to the trained one (marked by the
          red dashed line) even with the random initialization.
          <strong>Bottom</strong>: We first train a large subnet and then evaluate 100 smaller
          subnets derived from it without further training. Specifically, we obtain the small
          variants by cropping a subset of weights from the trained subnet randomly. We can see
          that the small subnets fail to maintain the performance of the well-trained one.

      <div class="col-sm-12 content">
        <p>Transformer architecture search (TAS) aims to automatically discover efficient vision
        transformers (ViTs), reducing the need for manual design. Existing TAS methods typically
        train an over-parameterized network (<em>i.e.</em>, a supernet) that encompasses all
        candidate architectures (<em>i.e.</em>, subnets). However, subnets partially share
        weights within the supernet, which leads to interference that degrades the smaller
        subnets severely. We have found that well-trained small subnets can serve as a good
        foundation for training larger ones. Motivated by this, we propose a progressive
        training framework, dubbed GrowTAS, that begins with training small subnets and
        incorporates larger ones gradually. This enables reducing the interference and
        stabilizing training. We also introduce GrowTAS+ that fine-tunes a subset of weights
        only to further enhance the performance of large subnets. Extensive experiments on
        ImageNet and several transfer learning benchmarks, including CIFAR-10/100, Flowers,
        CARS, and INAT-19, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over current TAS
        methods.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-12 caption">Quantitative results of transfer learning across multiple datasets: CIFAR-10/100, Flowers, Cars, and INAT-19. We report top-1 accuracy (%) and the number of model parameters. For GrowTAS-S (ours), we report mean ± std across 3 runs.</div>

      <div class="col-sm-12 content">We show in this table the results of GrowTAS on various downstream classification tasks, including CIFAR-10/100, Flowers, Cars, and iNat-19. We can see that GrowTAS-S achieves highly competitive or state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks. These datasets span a broad spectrum of domains, covering general objects, fine-grained categories, and large-scale species classification. This suggests that our progressive subnet training strategy effectively preserves transferable features, demonstrating its generalization ability across diverse domains.</div>
